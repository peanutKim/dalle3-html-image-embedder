# dalle3-html-image-embedder GitHub Action

This action enables the automatic ai generation of `<img>` elements from HTML comments. For instance, a comment in an HTML file will be transformed into an `<img>` element, created by DALL-E 3 based on the specified prompt:

```html
<!--image: studio ghibli styled plate of delicious food-->
```

## Quickstart
